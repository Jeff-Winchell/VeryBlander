    "### I. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of our project is to provide a brief exposition of the procedure employed in \"Redistricting and the Will of the People\" authored by Mattingly and Vaughn[1] and to reproduce some of the main results obtained in the original paper using programs we developed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The U.S. House of Representatives consists of 435 voting members elected from the fifty states every two years. The Constitution mandates that the number of seats allocated to each state be propotional to the size of the population (with the minimum of one seat for each state), and thus the number of seats can change following each decennial Census through a process called reapportionment. Redistricting refers to the process where the borders of Congressional Districts within a given state are redrawn, often (but not necessarily) following each reapportionment. In a majority of U.S. states, redistricting falls under the authority of the state legislature, while a minority of states utilize independent commissions for this purpose $[2]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the districts have to be generated by grouping the existing communities or other smaller geographic areas together, however, it is subject to what is often referred to as the Modifiable Aerial Unit Problem (MAUP): depending on a given scheme of aggregation, many statistics of interest such as correlation and local majority can shift significantly[3][4]. In fact, it is possible to use two different methods of aggregation on the same underlying data to produce correlation from $-1$ all the way to $1$[5]. In terms of redistricting, this problem often manifests itself in the form of Gerrymandering: a partisan-motivated redistricting that results in a substantial disparity between the share of the vote that a party receives and the proportion of seats that party controls.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mattingly and Vaughn took on the case of suspected Gerrymandering by state Republicans to ensure that they gained a disproportionate share of Congressional seats in the election of 2012. At the time of the election, Democratic candidates gained the majority of two-party votes, yet were only awarded three out of the thirteen districts drawn after the 2010 Census. To investigate how \"unusual\" the redistricting plan was in terms of the election result it produced, the authors of the original paper generated the probability distribution of redistricting based only on the neutral criteria of (i) equal population sizes and (ii) compactness of the shape of the districts and found that the actual 2010 redistricting was an extreme outlier from such a distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following sections, we first introduce the notations and concepts employed by the authors and explain the gist of the procedure used to sample nonpartisan redistricting plans. Then, we create our own set of codes to replicate the procedure and apply it to a toy example on an imaginary state with 25 Voting Tabulation Districts (VTDs) to provide a sense of how it works. Then as a final measure, we collect and aggregate the actual data from North Carolina to see if we obtain a conclusion similar to the authors'."

    "### II. Procedures\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two major criteria in evaluating whether a given redistricting plan is desirable, and correspondingly, how likely it is to be sampled in the simulated probability distribution. First is the equal division of population. In an extreme hypothetical case where one district only has one eligible voter and the other district has 100 such voters, then it can be said that the lone voter in the former would enjoy 100 times the average representation afforded to any voter in the latter. To ensure that such a gross violation of the principle of equal representation does not happen (or at least much less likely to appear compared to others), the sampling procedure has to prefer a redistricting plan that divides the state population into equal blocks of 13, ceteris paribus.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second criterion is the compactness of the shape of the districts. Since the American electoral system is based on the idea of geographic representation (i.e., an elected representative is responsible for safeguarding the interests of the people living in the communities that elected them), a need arises to preserve the boundaries of historical communities in drawing the lines of Congressional Districts. Although the principle itself does not say anything directly about the shape of the districts, we can observe that in many cases communities are formed among groups of people living closely together and that oftentimes Gerrymandering entails an arbitrary elongation of district boundaries into \"foreign\" territories to include and exclude certain constituents. Hence the compactness criterion punishes a redistricting plan that generates unneccary perturbations in district borders, once again ceteris paribus.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to incorporate these two criteria into sampling redistricting plans, the authors introduce the following notations and conventions.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, the state is represented as a graph $G$, with its vertices $V$ denoting the VTDs in the state and its edges $E$ connecting a pair of vertices if and only if the two VTDs are adjacent. Then, we can consider a redistricting plan $\\xi \\in \\mathcal{R}$ as a function that maps $V$ into the set $\\{1, 2, ..., 13 \\}$ s.t. each of the VTDs gets assigned to one of the thirteen Congressional Districts. Then a given $\\xi$ is evaluated according to the following quantities $J_{pop}(\\xi)$ and $J_{compact}(\\xi)$, which reflect the two criteria mentioned above.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{eqnarray*}\n",
    "J_{pop}(\\xi) &=& c_{pop} \\sum_{i = 1}^{N} (pop(D_i(\\xi)) - \\frac{N_{pop}}{N})^2 \\\\\n",
    "J_{compact}(\\xi) &=& c_{compact} \\sum_{i = 1}^{N} \\frac{(boundary(D_{\\cdot i}(\\xi)))^2}{area(D_{i}(\\xi))} \\\\\n",
    "\\end{eqnarray*}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\frac{N_{pop}}{N}$ is simply the average district-level population, $boundary(D_{\\cdot i}(\\xi))$ and $area(D_{i}(\\xi))$ are the length of the boundary and the area for district $D_i$, and $c_{pop}$ and $c_{compact}$, set to be $\\frac{1}{5000}$ and $2000$ respectively by the authors, are positive constants to make the two scores operate at roughly the same scale. We can see that these two quantities measure (squared) deviance from the two desirable criteria: $J_{pop}(\\xi)$ is minimized when all districts have equal populations and $J_{compact}(\\xi)$ is minimized if the districts approximate circles as closely as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "With these two scores defined, for any redistricting plan in which all CDs are connected, the criterion to be minimized is\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{eqnarray*}\n",
    "J_{\\lambda}(\\xi) &=& \\lambda J_{pop}(\\xi) + (1 - \\lambda) J_{compact}(\\xi)\n",
    "\\end{eqnarray*}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\lambda \\in [0, 1]$ controls the relative weight distributed to each of the two scores. The authors choose $\\lambda = .3$ as the default value that produces comparable (yet still lower) values of both scores to those of the actual districts in 2012, although they use several different values of $.1, .2, .3, .4$ along with two different size of the thinning parameter $m \\in \\{40K, 100K \\}$ in presenting the results. We can assign an arbitrarily large number to redistricting plans that do not result in contiguous districts to ensure that these plans are only sampled with probability $0$ later.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, the probability that $\\xi$ will be sampled is given by the following, with inverse temperature $\\beta > 0$:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{eqnarray*}\n",
    "\\mathcal{P}_{\\lambda, \\beta}(\\xi) &=& \\frac{\\text{exp}[- \\beta J_{\\lambda}(\\xi)]}{\\sum_{\\xi^{\\prime} \\in \\mathcal{R}} \\text{exp}[- \\beta J_{\\lambda}(\\xi^{\\prime})]}\n",
    "\\end{eqnarray*}\n",
    "\n",
    "where we can see $\\mathcal{P}_{\\lambda, \\beta}(\\xi)$ is inversely correlated with $J_{\\lambda}(\\xi)$ s.t. we are more likely to sample redistricting plans with smaller values of the combined criterion. In addition, $\\beta$ controls how strongly $J_{\\lambda}(\\xi)$ controls the probability: as $\\beta \\rightarrow 0$, we approximate a uniform sampling over $J_{\\lambda}(\\xi)$ while as $\\beta \\rightarrow \\infty$ the probability distribution becomes more sharply unimodal. The authors set $\\beta = .01$ after verifying it to be a reasonable value of the parameter that produces good candidate redistricting plans.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the sheer number of possible combinations make it difficult to perform simple random sampling, the authors of the original paper then uses Metropolis-Hastings algorithm to implement the sampling. The initial state is set to be the actual districts in 2012, and each step with $\\xi$ proposes a new plan $\\xi^{\\prime}$ according to the following procedure (we simplify the terminology used in the original paper:\n",
    "\n",
    "(i) randomly choose an edge at the borders of any two Congressional Districts and let the two VTDs associated with the edge as $u, v$;\n",
    "(ii) With $\\frac{1}{2}$ probability, either switch $u$ into $v$'s district or switch $v$ into $u$'s district.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, $q(\\xi, \\xi^{\\prime}) = \\frac{1}{2} con(\\xi)$ is used for the M-H algorithm where $con(\\xi)$ is the total number of candidate edges at step (i) for a given $\\xi$ and the acceptance probability is $\\min \\{1, \\frac{con(\\xi)}{con(\\xi')} \\text{exp}[- \\beta (J_{\\lambda} (\\xi^{\\prime}) - J_{\\lambda} (\\xi))]\\}$. However, for simplicty's sake, we will drop the factors of con in our implementation and thus set $\\frac{con(\\xi)}{con(\\xi')} =1$..\n",
    "\n",
    "To make sure that the proposals appropriately reflect the entire sample space, Mattingly and Vaughn use heating ($\\beta = .001$) and cooling ($\\beta = .01$) period where the heating period facilitates a thorough seach across the sample space and a sample is drawn at the end of the following cooling period which stabilizes the distribution. This alteration takes place by dividing the thinning parameter $m$ by two: the first to $\\frac{m}{2}$-th steps comprise the heating period, and $\\frac{m}{2} + 1$-th to $m$-th steps denote the cooling period.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the procedures have been implemented and the results were obtained, Mattingly and Vaughn find that when using $\\lambda \\in \\{.1, .2, .3, .4 \\}$ and $m \\in \\{40K, 100K \\}$, the median number of seats awarded to the Democratic candidates in the sampled redistricting plans were always between 6 and 8. In addition, across all such parameter specifications, at least 90\\% of the sampled plans elected $5$ to $9$ Democratic candidates, thus illustrating the extreme unlikelihood of the actual result in 2012 (and 2016) where Democrats only gained $3$."
